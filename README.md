# Connect4_Kotlin
# Overview

This was an exploration of programming in Kotlin for the benefit 
of my learning and furthering my knowledge of programming languages.

I programmed a basic connect 4 game as a way to explore how kotlin code works and functions.

# Development Environment

I used the IntelliJ IDE for the development of this project programming exclusively in Kotlin,
no special libraries were needed.
